I am a Ph.D. candidate in the department of [Public Policy and Administration at Florida International University](https://pa.fiu.edu/). My core research interests lie primarily in the areas of environmental policymaking, emergency management, and public participation. Before coming to FIU, I finished my B.Sc. and M.Sc. in City&Regional Planning and Urban Design respectively at [Izmir Institute of Technology](https://city.iyte.edu.tr/en/programs/graduate-programs/city-planning/). I also worked as a senior real estate appraisal consultancy expert in Turkey after my undergrad for 6 years. 

Having received interdisciplinary educational training in City and Regional Planning, Urban Design, and Public Affairs, I value knowledge creation in the convergence of various disciplines.
