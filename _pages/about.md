I am a postdoctoral fellow at the <a href="https://plan.cap.utah.edu/" target="_blank">University of Utah City and Metropolitan Planning Department</a> & <a href="https://resilience.utah.edu/about/">the NSF-Wired Global Center</a>. Before, I was a visiting scholar in the <a href="http://www.umass.edu/larp/">Department of Landscape Architecture and Regional Planning at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst</a>. My core research interests lie primarily in the areas of environmental planning and policymaking, climate change adaptation, climate migration, environmental justice, and community engagement. My current research is concerned with how climate change-induced population mobility is shaping urban systems and how planning and policymaking can address the pressures on affected communities. Before coming to UMass, Amherst, I received my Ph.D. in Public Affairs from the Department of <a href="https://pa.fiu.edu/">Public Policy and Administration at Florida International University</a>. I finished my B.Sc. and M.Sc. in City&Regional Planning and Urban Design respectively at <a href="https://city.iyte.edu.tr/en/programs/graduate-programs/city-planning/">Izmir Institute of Technology</a>. I also worked as a senior real estate appraisal consultancy expert in Turkey after my undergrad for 6 years. 

Having received interdisciplinary educational training in City and Regional Planning, Urban Design, and Public Affairs, I value knowledge creation in the convergence of various disciplines.
